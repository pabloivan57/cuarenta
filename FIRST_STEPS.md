# Programming Cuarenta in Haskell

1. Set up your local environment with Haskell Platform
2. git clone this repository
3. Make sure that your Haskell environment works with `runghc Main.hs`.
   You should see, "Hola Cuarenta"

# Getting started with Haskell

Often programming in Haskell iterates between definining basic types that you
require and writing functions that operate over those data types. Here are some
steps to get started:

1. Write a `data` definition for the cards that will be used by the game
2. Write a function that returns a hand (this could be a List data type).
